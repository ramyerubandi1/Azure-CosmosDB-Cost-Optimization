# **How to Cut Your Azure Database Costs by 65%**

---

## **Current Setup**

* All your data is stored in **Azure Cosmos DB** — high-speed, premium storage.
* But most of the data is **rarely accessed**, except the recent 3 months.
* You're paying **\$3,600 per month**, even for cold, unused data.

---

## **What's the Problem?**

You're treating *every* file like it's urgent, when only a small percentage actually is.

---

## **The Better Approach: Smarter Data Storage**

### Think of it like organizing your office:

* Keep recent files in your **desk drawer** (fast access).
* Move older files to the **archive room** (cheaper space).
* Use a system that always knows where everything is.

---

## **Step 1: Use Two Types of Storage**

* **Hot Storage** (for active data):
  Store only the most recent 3 months in Cosmos DB.

* **Cold Storage** (for inactive data):
  Move older files to Azure Blob Storage (much cheaper).

---

## **Step 2: Automate the Workflow**

A small program runs every night:

1. **Scans for files** older than 3 months.
2. **Moves them** to Blob Storage.
3. **Leaves behind a pointer** that says:
   “File XYZ is now in archive location ABC.”
4. **Deletes the original** after 7 days.

---

## **When a User Requests a File**

1. App checks Cosmos DB (hot storage).
2. If not found, it follows the pointer to Blob Storage.
3. Fetches the file and returns it.
4. **User never notices** any difference — the process is fast and invisible.

## **Cost Comparison**

|                        | Before  | After             |
| ---------------------- | ------- | ----------------- |
| Cosmos DB Usage        | 600 GB  | 150 GB            |
| Monthly Cosmos DB Cost | \$3,600 | \$1,200           |
| Blob Storage Cost      | –       | \$45              |
| **Total Cost**         | \$3,600 | **\$1,245**       |
| **Monthly Savings**    | –       | **\$2,355 (65%)** |

## **4-Week Implementation Plan**

### Week 1: Prepare Archive Storage

* Set up Azure Blob Storage.
* Test access and integration.

### Week 2: Automate the File Movement

* Create a scheduled task to scan and move old files.
* Test it with a small set.

### Week 3: Update Your Applications

* Modify file-access logic to check both storage locations.
* Ensure performance is unaffected.

### Week 4: Go Live

* Enable full automation.
* Monitor storage usage and retrieval logs.

## **Benefits for Everyone**

### For the Business:

* Saves **\$28,260 per year**.
* No interruptions or rework.
* System runs faster and scales better.

### For Users:

* Same app experience.
* No delays or disruptions.
* No learning curve — it just works.

### For IT Teams:

* Low maintenance — it runs on autopilot.
* Easy to scale and configure.
* Fully reversible and safe.

## **A Familiar Analogy: Like Netflix**

* **New releases** are on fast servers.
* **Older titles** are stored more cheaply — but available instantly.
* The user doesn’t know or care — they just hit "Play."

---

## **Impact on Your System**

* No major changes to front-end or APIs.
* No retraining or support burden.
* Only thing that changes? **Your monthly Azure bill.**

---

## **Why This Works**

* Uses Azure-native, proven services.
* Transition is **gradual and safe**.
* Files can be restored to hot storage anytime.
* Works whether you have 2 million files or 20 million.

---

## **Bottom Line**

You're not cutting performance — you're cutting waste.

You get:

* The **same experience** for users,
* A **faster and leaner system**,
* And **thousands saved** every month — all without anyone noticing a thing.
